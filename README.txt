Clayton's Resume — Netlify Drop
===============================

1) Put your files in the assets folder.
2) Keep the filenames that data.js expects OR update js/data.js to match your real filenames.
3) Open index.html locally to preview.
4) Drag-and-drop the entire folder into Netlify.

Folders:
- assets/img/headshots
- assets/img/studio
- assets/img/live
- assets/img/artwork
- assets/audio/day1-demos
- assets/audio/finished
- assets/audio/board-tapes
- assets/video
- assets/docs

Edit:
- js/data.js (titles + file paths)
